# Conssole Akinator ðŸŽ©  

A console-based Akinator game built with **C#**, **Microsoft Semantic Kernel**, and **OpenAI** where the AI tries to guess what you're thinking by asking yes or no questions!  

## How It Works

Akinator is a guessing game that tries to figure out what you're thinking by asking a series of yes or no questions. It starts with broad questions and gradually becomes more specific until it makes a guess. Categories include humans, animals, objects, places, concepts, events, and mythical creatures. If Akinator is confident, it makes a guess and asks if you want to play again.

## Prerequisites  
- Download and Install [.NET 9.0 SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
- OpenAI API Key: Set as an environment variable named `ConsoleAkinator_OpenAIKey`.  

## Setup
1. Clone the repository:  
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/slalithprasad/cosnoleakinator.git
    cd consoleakinator
    ```
2. Install the required NuGet packages:  
    ```bash
    dotnet restore
    ```
3. Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable:  
    - On Windows:  
      ```powershell
      [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("ConsoleAkinator_OpenAIKey", "your_openai_key", "User")
      ```
    - On MacOS/Linux:  
      ```bash
      export ConsoleAkinator_OpenAIKey="your_openai_key"
      ```

## Running the Game  
```bash
dotnet run
```

## Gameplay  
- ðŸŽ© The AI asks questions to figure out what you're thinking.  
- Respond with:  
  - **'y'** for **Yes**  
  - **'n'** for **No**  
  - **'e'** to **Exit**  
- If the AI guesses correctly, it will ask if you want to play again.
